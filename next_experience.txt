** NextJs is a React framework for production ==>
  
  Next.js is a react framewark that enables you to build superfast and extremely
  user-friendly static websites, as well as full fledge production ready web
  applications using react.


  In fact, thanks to Automatic Siatic Optimzation, “static” and “dynamic” become
  one now.

  This feature allows Next.js to build hybrid applications (that runs on all devices) that contain both server-
  rendered and statically generated pages. 

  We get file based routing 
  Nex help us to create Production ready app

  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


  ** Why NextJs =======>

  The big reason to choose nextjs is its SEO Effeciency

  It is using Server Side Rendering (SSR) and at the same time. It can be also a great Static Site Generator (SSG)

  Google did not search in react website as ith has only div id = "root" in page source. But in next all html load so its better for seo

  Next.js websites are superfast , easy to scan, and provide a great user experience and that's why Google will favor them above others and rank them higher.

  file based routing

  Support for css modules

  Pre-rendering (better SEO)

  Image Optimization ('next/image')

  API Route ('pages/api/user.js)

  Typrscript Support

  Dev and Production based system

  
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


  ** To install Nextjs ========>

  npx create-next-app appname


 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


 to make about page than in app.js => new folder => about => new file page.js

 in the router http://localhost:3000/about


 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


 to use css ==>

 //make file in styles ==> name the file header.module.css

 name the file header.module.css

 than in header import styles from "./header.module.css"

 than className={styles.classname}


 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 to use Link ==>

 import Link from "next/link";

 <Link href="/home">home</Link>

 for image (it is in public===> public=>vercel.svg)

 <Image src="/vercel.svg" alt="image" width={150} height={100} />


 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 In global css what css we write applied to all over

 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 to add fontfamily 

 import { Roboto } from "next/font/google";

 const roboto = Roboto({
  weight: "400",
  subsets: ["latin"],
  display: "swap",
});

<html lang="en" className={roboto.className}>


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

to dynamic route like useparams

like we have to give route ===> local:3000/blog/5

so in blog folder ===> new folder [id] ==> in [id] new file page.jsx


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


for grouping of pages like we dont want to give route so we can use ()

ex ===> in folder dashboard ==> new folder name as (auth) ==> in this login and register

so the route is local:3000/dashboard/login not local:3000/dashboard/auth/login


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


so its good idea to make (pages) folder inside it make all page so it does not take route as well it is well managed


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In next js all pages rendered as a server Side

but if we want  page to go client side (like header,footer shoul be run on client side) on the top of page write  "use client"

we can check the page render server side or client that if we console.log("hello)==> if its console in browser than it client side and if it console in vs code terminal than ita s server side


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

we can use react bootstrap in nextjs ==> npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

for right image use in next js

<div className={styles.container_img}>
<Img src="/logo.png" fill={true} alt="logo" />  //fill={true} fill width height according to container
</div>

.container_img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
}


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


If we want to use image through external link it shows error 

   <Image
        src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/16944644/pexels-photo-16944644/free-photo-of-woman-walking-on-mountain-meadow.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1"
        fill={true}
        alt="logo"
      /> 

It gives error... For This ===>
In next.config.js

const nextConfig = {
  images: { domains: ["images.pexels.com"] },
};

we get the domain name on error come as well

TUTORIAL TO MAKE APP USING CHATGPT

First use this command ==>

I want you to become my prompt engineer. your goal is to help me craft the best possile prompt for my needs. 
The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the follwoing process:

1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it througth continual iterations by going through the next steps.
2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections. (a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), (b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).
3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additonal information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we are done.

#

You can use this type example like ===> i want to code an matrimonial app (for better result)

# 

please answer the prompt maximumb by 10 times . After that give prompt "ok go now"

# 

the steps provided than give prompt "provide all the steps in more details"

# 

than prompt "ok great now from above points make use cases"

# 

than prompt "ok now lets start with use case 1 with file folder structure and code "

# 

than prompt "than next step "

# 

than prompt "than next step "


This is the basic prompt

######################################################################

** Now if any basic error occurs like you dont know how to use certain language than ask this question to chatgpt in another chat otherwise it focus on your this prompts and forgot the project steps...
